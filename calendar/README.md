Calendar Sharing
    - users can share their calendar events with another user
        - type username of sharee into input
        - events now display for both users


Group Events
    - users can create groups
        - enter the usernames of other users in inputs, then select "create group"
        - note: group minimum size = 2, maximum size = 3
    - users can create events for groups
        - users select "create group event" from homepage
